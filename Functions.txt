Sure, here are five problems that range from easy to hard, focusing on Python functions:

1. **Easy: Sum of Two Numbers**
   - Write a function called `add_numbers` that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum.

2. **Easy/Medium: Factorial**
   - Write a function called `calculate_factorial` that takes a number as a parameter and returns its factorial. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers up to that number.

3. **Medium: Palindrome Check**
   - Write a function called `is_palindrome` that takes a string as a parameter and returns `True` if it's a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward), and `False` otherwise.

4. **Medium/Hard: Fibonacci Sequence**
   - Write a function called `generate_fibonacci` that takes a number `n` as a parameter and returns the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

5. **Hard: Prime Factorization**
   - Write a function called `prime_factorization` that takes a number as a parameter and returns a list of its prime factors. Prime factorization is the process of finding the prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number.
